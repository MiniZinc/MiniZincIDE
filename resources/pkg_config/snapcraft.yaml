  MiniZinc is a free and open-source constraint modeling language. You can
  use MiniZinc to model constraint satisfaction and optimization problems in
  a high-level, solver-independent way, taking advantage of a large library
  of pre-defined constraints. Your model is then compiled into FlatZinc, a
  solver input language that is understood by a wide range of solvers.
